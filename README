 contains drivers for the following:

 * driverlib
  - TI MSP430 DriverLib (provided as git submodule)

 * glue
  - i2c with blocking implementation based on the TI DriverLib
  - i2c controlled by interrupts (IRQ_I2C)
  - bitbanged i2c
  - uart with optional interrupt driven tx
  - system messagebus
  - ring buffer

 * drivers
  - Honeywell High Accuracy Ceramic (HSC) and Standard Accuracy Ceramic (SSC) piezoresistive silicon pressure sensors
  - Sensirion SHT 1x humidity and temperature sensors
  - Maxim DS3231 rtc IC
  - Maxim DS3234 rtc IC
  - Analog Devices AD7789 adc IC
  - Cypress FM24* i2c FRAM IC
  - Texas Instruments TCA6408 IO expander 

 * tests
  - a Makefile driven collection of unit tests for different drivers

 * tools
  - generic script for flashing uCs

 software requirements:

	msp430 toolchain
	make
	Linux OS (for makefile scripts). might work with WSL or cygwin, not tested.

	tested on a stable Gentoo Linux system with Mitto Systems GCC 9.3.1.1-based toolchain
